        <p>Nestlé began developing a coffee brand in 1930, at the initiative of the Brazilian government, to help to preserve the substantial surplus of the annual Brazilian coffee harvest. Max Morgenthaler led the development project. Nestlé introduced the new product under the brand name "Nescafé" on April 1, 1938.[1] Nescafé is a soluble powdered coffee that became an American staple during World War II.[2]

            In 1965, Nestlé introduced a freeze-dried coffee brand called "Nescafé Gold" in Europe.[1]
            
            In 1966, Nestlé developed a freeze-dried coffee brand under the name Taster's Choice.[2]</p>
